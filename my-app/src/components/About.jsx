      <p id="aboutText">Pokémon, short for "Pocket Monsters," is a popular franchise created by Satoshi Tajiri and Ken Sugimori. It began as a video game series developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo and has since expanded into various media, including an animated television series, movies, trading card games, toys, and more.
      In the Pokémon world, trainers catch and train creatures called Pokémon to battle each other for sport. Each Pokémon species has its own unique abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. Trainers aim to become Pokémon Masters by defeating other trainers and completing the Pokédex, an encyclopedia that catalogs all known Pokémon species.
